## Description

    If you are like me, I was frustrated for a long time by the lack of support for the epic games community who own Paradox games such as HOI4 or EU4, thus i created this mod installer to make everyones life a little better.
    
    This is a simple mod installer for Paradox Interactive games, built using Python and Tkinter. With this tool, you can easily install mods for your favorite Paradox games without having to manually extract zip files and modify .mod files.
